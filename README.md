**📄 Resume Screening & Classification System**
An NLP-based Resume Screening System that automatically classifies resumes into relevant job categories using Deep Learning (LSTM). This project helps recruiters and hiring teams reduce manual screening effort by providing fast, accurate, and scalable resume classification.

**🚀 Features**
- Automated resume text preprocessing
- Tokenization & sequence padding for deep learning
- LSTM-based neural network for multi-class classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report
- Scalable design for future deployment as a web app or API

**🧠 Problem Statement**
Recruiters often spend hours manually reviewing resumes. This project solves that problem by building an AI-powered system that:
- Reads resume text
- Understands skill patterns
- Predicts the most suitable job category automatically

**🛠 Tech Stack**
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLP techniques (tokenization, sequence padding)
- LSTM Neural Networks

**⚙️ How It Works**
- Data Loading – Reads resume dataset
- Text Preprocessing – Cleans and normalizes resume text
- Tokenization – Converts text into numeric sequences
- Model Training – LSTM network learns resume patterns
- Evaluation – Measures accuracy and classification performance
- Prediction – Classifies new resumes into job categories

**📊 Model Architecture**
- Embedding Layer – Converts words to dense vectors
- SpatialDropout1D – Reduces overfitting
- LSTM Layer – Learns contextual relationships in text
- Dense Layers – Final classification with Softmax

**📈 Results**
Achieved 99.17% accuracy in multi-class resume classification using an LSTM-based NLP model, outperforming baseline machine learning models such as KNN (98.3%) and Naive Bayes (94.19%). The system significantly improves over traditional keyword-based screening by enabling accurate, automated candidate categorization.

**🔮 Future Improvements**
- Add Streamlit web app for live resume upload
- Deploy model using FastAPI
- Upgrade to BERT / Transformer embeddings
- Add skill-gap analysis module
- Integrate RAG-based career suggestions

**📌 Use Cases**
- HR Tech platforms
- Recruitment automation
- Career guidance systems
- Resume analytics tools

**🏆 What This Project Demonstrates**
- Strong fundamentals in NLP & Deep Learning
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Real-world problem solving
- Production-ready mindset
